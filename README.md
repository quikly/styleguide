styleguide
==========

# General Code
* use two spaces instead of tabs (you can set your editor to "soft tabs" for this)


# Images
* filenames all lowercase
* use three-letter extensions (jpg, not jpeg)
* append retina versions with "@2x" before the extension. Non-retina graphics should *not* include "@1x"
* name associated images with the same prefix (fathead_gb.jpg, fathead_dis.jpg, not bg_fathead.jpg, dis_fathead.jpg).

# HTML
* use html5 tags at will


# CSS
* favor clean markup over selector performance
* it's ok to use id tags when the elements are really unique
* reuse classes whenever possible.
* never add a class name unless you need to customize a style (in other words, do not add a class unless it has a reference in css or javascript)
* if possible, use cascading styles rather than adding new classes to ever element.


# javascript
* semi-colons at the end of lines are not necessary. checkout twitter bootstraps raw js for inspiration
